/*
  QTRSensors.h - Library for using Pololu QTR reflectance
    sensors and reflectance sensor arrays: QTR-1A, QTR-8A, QTR-1RC, and
    QTR-8RC.  The object used will determine the type of the sensor (either
    QTR-xA or QTR-xRC).  Then simply specify in the constructor which
    Arduino I/O pins are connected to a QTR sensor, and the read() method
    will obtain reflectance measurements for those sensors.  Smaller sensor
    values correspond to higher reflectance (e.g. white) while larger
    sensor values correspond to lower reflectance (e.g. black or a void).

    * QTRSensorsRC should be used for QTR-1RC and QTR-8RC sensors.
    * QTRSensorsAnalog should be used for QTR-1A and QTR-8A sensors.
